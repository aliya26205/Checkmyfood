# 🍽️ CheckMyFood

**CheckMyFood** is a web-based food barcode scanner that helps users verify the **safety of packaged food items** before consumption. By scanning a barcode, it fetches real-time product data from the **Open Food Facts API** and displays essential information such as allergens, additives, nutritional content, and a calculated **Safety Percentage** using a visual gauge.
